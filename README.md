# Chrome Extension Tutorial

A generic bootstrap template for creating simple Chrome browser extensions. Also works with Brave browser.

## Components

- common.js = functions common to the extension, available to both the other files.
- main.js = executes when extension icon is clicked.
- onload.js = executes when any tab finishes loading.

## Use

1. In the Chrome extensions tab under `Settings`, turn on `Developer Mode`.
1. Install extension via the `Load unpacked` button. Select the 'first-extension' directory and load that.
